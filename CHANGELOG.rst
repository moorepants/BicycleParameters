Release Notes
=============

1.2.0
-----

- Support Python 3.13.
- Revert to ``unumpy.matrix`` in mass center and inertia calculations.
- Updated the raw data mat file loading to work with current Python versions.
- Support raw data pendulum measurement files with time as an array as well as
  a fixed sample rate (as before).
- Remove the unnecessary ``__new__`` method from ``Bicycle``.
- Added options to show stable ranges and to hide zero eigenvalues in the
  ``Model`` eigenvalues parts plot.
- Skip data truncation on raw pendulum time series that have the explicit time
  array (this is a hack for the Balanceassistv1 data to have valid handlebar
  inertia).
- Modernized some internal plotting code.
- Added measured and calculated parameter data for the Balanceassistv1 bike we
  measured in the summer of 2024. This is a Gazelle Grenoble C8 HMB electric
  bicycle with a custom headtube with a steering motor.

1.1.1
-----

- Ensure that the app's data files are installed.

1.1.0
-----

  - https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleParameters/pull/34
  - https://github.com/moorepants/BicycleParameters/pull/88

- Dropped support for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, and 3.7. Added support for
  Python 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12.
- Bumped dependency minimum verions to match Ubuntu 22.04.
- Moved to mamba and Github action based continuous integration testing.
- Introduced new parameter_sets and models modules for future class hierarchies
  and better design.
- ``bicycleparameters/test/`` moved to ``bicycleparameters/tests/``.
- Removed remaining NumPy ``matrix()`` calls.
- Improved some of the matplotlib plots.
