# yeadon python module (cld72@cornell.edu)
# Measurement input template.
# Lines beginning with pound (#) are comment lines.
# There are 95 distance measurements, consisting of lengths,
# perimeters, widths, and
# depths.
#
# For details about how the measurements are to be taken, consult the
# journal article Yeadon 1989-ii or the documentation of this python package.
#
# CONVERSION FACTOR to convert measurements INTO meters
# (set to 1 if measurements are in meters, 0.001 if measurements are in mm,
# 0.0254 if measurements are in inches)
measurementconversionfactor = .1
#
# DENSITY CORRECTION
# the mass of the human can be set to a measured mass (by scaling the densities
# used) if the totalmass field below is set to a a value greater than 0.
# Alternatively, the next line can be deleted from the input file.

# depth: the presence of the shoulder joint at Ls4, the shoulder joint centre, 
# makes it difficult to measure the width of the Ls4 stadium. Therefore the
# depth (=2r) of the stadium is measured instead.
